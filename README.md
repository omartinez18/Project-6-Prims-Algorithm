# Project-6-Prims-Algorithm
Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees
This program reads a weighted undirected graph from stdin and writes the structure of the MST to stdout.
The input will consist of a set of alphanumeric (string) vertex identifiers on one line, separated by spaces. The vertices will be followed by a list of edges, one edge per line, specified by two vertex identifiers and a numerical weight. You may assume the input will not deviate from this format.
Input file, test.in, contains the vertexes and edges plus the weight of those assigned edges.
